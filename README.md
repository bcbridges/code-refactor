# [Code-Refactor](https://bcbridges.github.io/code-refactor/) Website

## Description of Project

This code was refactored to provide clarity and visual ease for current and future developers of the site. The following elements were refactored.

### index.html

- Non-semantic elements were changed to semantic.
- Alternative text was added to each image to enhance screen reader's experience.
- Three classes were changed to ids to allow link features in the navigation bar to perform properly.

### style.css

- Duplicate rulesets were merged to shorted the length of code without changing the user interface.
- Comments were added to provide a brief description of merged elements.
- Classes that were changed to ids in index.html had their respective ruleset selectors updated to reflect properly.
